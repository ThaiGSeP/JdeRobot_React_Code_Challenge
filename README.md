## Idea

Daily task management just got easier with Task Tracking. With an easy-to-see interface, ensuring information security. Label task tasks based on the task's status ("TO DO", "IN PROGRESS", "DONE").

## Feature

1. Allows entering Title, description, Material URL, and Deadline for each task.

2. Allows to edit the status of each task.

3. User information is stored locally in the computer (local storage).

4. Sort tasks horizontally based on task completion status.

5. Sort tasks vertically, based on 2 options (Sort by Title, Sort by Deadline).

6. Display notifications about the latest deadlines of tasks.
